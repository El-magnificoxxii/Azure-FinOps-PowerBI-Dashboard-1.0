# 💰 Azure FinOps Power BI Dashboard 1.0

## 📘 Overview
This project demonstrates the use of **Power BI** for analyzing and visualizing **Azure cost and usage data** 
The dashboard provides key insights into **service-level spending**, **cost efficiency**, and **regional usage patterns**, enabling organizations to make data-driven decisions around cloud optimization and governance.

> **Note:** The dataset used in this project is a *sample CSP daily rate usage file* created for demonstration.  
> All data points are fictional and do not reflect any real customers or organizations.

## 🎯 Objectives
The goal of this project is to:
- Show how **FinOps principles** can be applied to Azure cost data.
- Provide visibility into **spending patterns across services, regions, and customers**.
- Identify **high-cost areas** and opportunities for optimization.
- Demonstrate **Power BI modelling and DAX proficiency**.

## 🧠 Key Insights From the Dashboard
1. **Top Services by Spend:** Identifies which Azure services (e.g., Virtual Machines, VPN Gateway, Storage) contribute most to total costs.  
2. **Cost per Service:** Calculates cost efficiency by dividing total cost of each service by the number of active resources within that service..  
3. **Daily Cost Trend:** Tracks day-to-day fluctuations to reveal unusual cost spikes.  
4. **Regional Usage:** Highlights which Azure regions drive the most consumption.  
5. **Average Cost per Resource:** Provides a detailed breakdown of services (e.g., VM series) to analyze cost performance by category and determine each category’s percentage of the total cost. 
6. **Customer Spend Analysis:** Shows the top-spending customers for transparency and billing insight.
